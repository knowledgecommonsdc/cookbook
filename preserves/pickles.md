Ingredients
-----------

- About six pickles in the 4-6 inch range.
- A clove of garlic (optional)
- Maybe about 1/4 of an onion (optional)
- Some hot pepper (optional; didn't use in the most recent batch)
- 4-6 tbsp. salt (preferably sea salt; koshering salt and table salt are harsh)
- 2 cups white vinegar (I ran out of white vinegar and used about half rice wine vinegar)
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup spices (see below)



Method
------

1. Wash the cucumbers well, then slice into discs of about 1/4 to 1/3 inch thickness. (Thinner slices will pickle faster.) Use the ends of the cucumber for something else - they contain an enzyme that makes pickles soft, and these are quite crisp.

2. Put the salt, sugar, and vinegar into a pot and bring to a boil.

3. Place the pickle slices into jars. If you're using garlic, onion, or hot pepper, mix these in. Shaking the jar will help distribute the pickle slices.

4. Let the pickling liquid cool for about five minutes, then pour it into the jars. Seal the jars and let them cool. 

5. Let sit in a refrigerator to cure. It's quite pickly after 24 hours but 2-3 days will develop a stronger flavor. These pickles are not shelf-stable and need to be refrigerated.

Pickling Spices
---------------

There is much room for variation here. I think that whole spices work better than powdered. Mix these spices - you can crush them lightly with a mortar and pestle or with the flat of a knife.

Roughly equal parts:

- dill seeds
- mustard seeds
- black pepperorns
- coriander seeds

And:

- A few dill leaves
- Some allspice berries
- Some nutmeg - not too much, as it can be overpowering
- A little cumin - again, not too much unless you want a distinctly South Asian effect
- Cayenne pepper, ground
