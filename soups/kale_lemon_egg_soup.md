# Kale-lemon-egg soup

Like avgolemono‎, but with kale.

Make a broth with veggie bouillon. Flavor with dried herbs (sage and thyme work well), olive oil, lemon, black pepper, and garlic.

Add finely-chopped kale and orichette (probably best if the pasta is already cooked). 

Prepare the avgolemono‎ mixture: beat an egg with lemon juice. Turn the heat down – the broth *must not boil* or you'll get egg-drop soup. Add the lemon-egg mixture and stir well.
